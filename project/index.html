            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>No Excuse Hunting and Outdoors is dedicated to everyone who enjoys all the outdoors has to offer regardless of a
                physical or visual disability.</p>
        
            <p>No Excuse Hunting and Outdoors believes that having a disability is not the same as having an inability to enjoy
                outdoors activities.</p>
        
            <p>We encourage everyone to enjoy the outdoors regardless of what challenges life has put in the way. Success is not
                measured by harvesting an animal on a hunt or landing a fish, but by going outdoors and doing what many take for
                granted despite having a visual or physical disability.</p>

                <div class="founder-text">
                    <p>Not everyone with a disability is born with it. Many are acquired through life from car
                        accidents, illness, or military service. No Excuse Hunting assists and encourages people with a
                        physical or visual disability to try something new or to not abandon a life's passion due to a
                        disability.</p>

                    <p>In February 2014 I lost my eyesight to a car accident but did not lose my passion for the
                        outdoors. When I was discharged from the hospital and rehab center several months later, I
                        discovered I was drawn for bull elk with my friend Brian Nichols. With help we overcame many
                        challenges during that hunt and those challenges lead me to start No Excuse Hunting.</p>

                    <p>In 2016 the First No Excuse Hunting C.H.A.M.P. (Challenged Hunter Access Mobility Program) Day
                        was held at Bass Pro Shop in Mesa, Arizona. This annual event has featured hunters who view
                        their disability as just another challenge and refuse to allow it to impede a love for the
                        outdoors. The expos also include organizations that help those with their challenges, products,
                        guides and outfitters. There's something for everyone, not just those with disabilities.</p>

                    <p>We have donated hunting, fishing, and outdoor equipment to those with disabilities. Together with
                        donation from sponsors and our volunteers we have held fishing events, Arizona hog hunting,
                        Oklahoma archery white-tail, and New Mexico cow elk hunts. Check back for our future events.</p>
