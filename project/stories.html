                    <h3>7 Days From Field To Surgical Ward</h3>

                        <strong>February 2018</strong></p>

                    <p><em>"Counting coup was the winning of prestige against an enemy by the Plains Indians of North
                            America. Warriors won prestige by acts of bravery in the face of the enemy, which could be
                            recorded in various ways and retold as stories. Any blow struck against the enemy counted as
                            a coup, but the most prestigious acts included touching an enemy warrior with the hand, bow,
                            or coup stick and escaping unharmed. Risk of injury or death was required to count
                            coup.</em></p>

                    <p><em>Escaping unharmed while counting coup was considered a higher honor than being wounded in the
                            attempt. A warrior who won coup was permitted to wear an eagle feather in his hair. If he
                            had been wounded in the attempt, however, he was required to paint the feather red to
                            indicate this."</em></p>

                    <p><strong>I will be wearing a RED eagle feather!</strong></p>

                    <p>Thursday night, Feb. 1st, 2018, I was laying in room 3104 of the Arrowhead Hospital surgical ward
                        having the contents of my upper GI sucked out through my nose, waiting to be rushed into surgery
                        to have my intestines unblocked and a colostomy bag installed.</p>

                    <p>The prior Thursday, Jan. 25th, 2018, I was laying in Eddie Willey's guest room, listening to the
                        chatter of his three beautiful daughters, waiting for the 4:30AM alarm to sound and the archery
                        deer hunt to start.</p>

                    <p>Eddie got me on deer, period!</p>

                    <p>Friday morning, five minutes after Eddie drove off with my van, a 160-inch 4x4 mule deer came
                        within 32 yards with his five girlfriends. He was a handsome buck. Unfortunately, Dads and my
                        "buck fever" got the better of us. I made a move to release my bolt at 52 yards but he turned
                        and bounded off.</p>

                    <p>Friday night, at dusk, I had an easy 100 yard shot on a nice 4x4 mule deer. I wanted to release
                        that bolt with every fiber of my being but I just couldn't make out his antlers with my 2x
                        scope. We stared at that buck for five minutes. Eddie knew it was a buck but he was 100yds from
                        me with no way to communicate to us. He was a fat boy!</p>

                    <p>Saturday morning, a 115+ inch Coues buck came within 200 yds us. He was making his way to us when
                        he caught a doe's scent and chased her over the hill.</p>

                    <p>Saturday night, I took my shot! Two does followed by a small 3x3 crossed inline from my right to
                        left. I lined up on the first doe. Dad called off 62yds as the second doe crossed through my
                        crosshairs. The buck took one step away, turned back toward the two does and moved into my
                        crosshairs. As his shoulder hit my 60yd pin, I pressed my electronic release, and she rang out!
                        The buck hit the ground and took off like a scalded cat on tile. I thought I missed and reloaded
                        but he was gone! We found no blood on the ground but dad found the bolt with five inches missing
                        off the front and broken in front of the fletchings. Eddie found a smear of blood on the bolt.
                        It appears the buck was at 67 yards and my bolt hit it behind the leg and ricocheted down off
                        its ribs. That buck received a painful education, but he'll be fine.</p>

                    <p>We left Sunday morning. Eddie went back out that night and watched 200+ come into the field. Like
                        wildebeests on the plains of Africa!</p>

                    <p>I hunted deer 9 days this season, my buck never fell.</p>

                    <p>When Dad and I started this adventure fourteen months ago we knew it was going to be hard, our
                        Everest. Not only was the preparation going to be hard and costly, the hunt, extremely taxing
                        and the likelihood of injury and/or death would be high. Why would someone with a terminal
                        disease risk everything for the mere, and unlikely, chance to harvest a big game animal?</p>

                    <p><strong>The answer is simple</strong></p>

                    <p>I am willing to give up everything to witness God's raw beauty for just one moment. I've lived in
                        a gilded cage for 40 years, a cage created by fear. The goal was always to extend my life, a
                        year, a month, a day. The goal was time, I was alive but not living. I gave myself eighteen
                        months before returning to the "gilded cage" permanently. I made fourteen.</p>

                    <p>I am now being asked to stop.</p>

                    <p>I was released from the hospital yesterday at 5PM. No surgery and I'm still using the exit hole
                        God created.</p>

                    <p><strong>(Updated 2021)</strong> Despite a week in the ICU, I made the hunt! Four days in the
                        field with nary a sign of javelina but frostbite scars that will remind me of this hunt for
                        years to come. I would finally take a 65lbs sow and a forked-horn mule deer buck with Eddie and
                        Nate during the 2019 fall deer season (After 26 years of trying, I broke down and bought a
                        Governor's Tag.). Covid-19 destroyed my 2020 javelina season. If all goes well, I'll be back
                        hunting javelina this February 19th, 2021.</p>

                    <p class="story-meta">Hunter: <strong>Mike Pickens</strong> | Activity: <strong>Hunting</strong></p>

                    <p>I have been hunting most of my life. I started around 12 and I had a great teacher and it was my
                        Dad. I learned a lot from him and I remember when my whole family made it a family event. My
                        kids would go with us and love it and I have great memories.</p>

                    <p>And then I had a curve ball happen in my life. I lost my right leg about 4 years ago and thought
                        my hunting adventures were done!</p>

                    <p>But then I realized that God gave me the strength and the will. And even though I have to ask
                        people for help, and I had to swallow my pride and to ask for help, I found out who were my real
                        friends. And I could have stopped doing something that I love to do!</p>

                    <p>But I can tell you that if you have some type of disability it doesn't mean you have to quit
                        doing stuff that you love to do. And I still love to get out and go fishing and hunting when I
                        get the chance and get lucky to get drawn!</p>

                    <p>You can sit at home and moan and complain and feel sorry for yourself, or you can pull up your
                        boots and start living. And I'm a veteran and I learned to adapt and overcome your obstacle!</p>

                        everyone."</blockquote>
