            <h2>Target Audience / Purpose</h2>
            <p>No Excuse Hunting and Outdoors is dedicated to everyone who enjoys all the outdoors has to offer regardless
                of a physical or visual disability. We believe that having a disability is not the same as having an
                inability to enjoy the outdoors. We encourage everyone to enjoy the outdoors regardless of what challenges
                life has put in the way. Success is not measured by harvesting an animal on a hunt or landing a fish, but by
                going outdoors and doing what many take for granted despite having a visual or physical disability.</p>
